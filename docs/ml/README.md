# ML Design & Decision Documentation

This directory documents the **step-by-step ML reasoning**
used to design and validate the final model.

These documents complement the notebooks by explaining
**why** decisions were made, not just **what** was done.

## 📚 Documentation Flow

The ML system was built through the following stages:

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Business objective
   - Prediction target
   - Constraints

2. **Dataset Overview**
   - Data source
   - Feature descriptions
   - Quality considerations

3. **Feature Understanding**
   - Numerical vs categorical features
   - Distributions and relationships

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Patterns, correlations, outliers

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Imputation
   - Encoding
   - Train/test splitting

6. **Modeling & Evaluation**
   - Baselines
   - Tree-based models
   - Cross-validation results

7. **Feature Engineering & Boosting**
   - Engineered features
   - Gradient boosting selection

## 🧠 Purpose of These Docs

- Capture modeling decisions
- Provide traceability
- Support reproducibility
- Serve as a design record

These documents represent the **ML design history** of the project.
