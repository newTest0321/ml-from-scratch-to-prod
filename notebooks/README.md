# Notebooks — ML Experimentation

This directory contains **exploratory notebooks** used during
model development and experimentation.

Notebooks are used to:
- explore data
- test modeling ideas
- evaluate feature engineering
- compare model families


## 📘 Notebook Flow

1. `01_feature_exploration.ipynb`  
   Data understanding and feature inspection

2. `02_linear_model.ipynb`  
   Linear and ridge regression baselines

3. `03_tree_based_models.ipynb`  
   Decision trees and random forest models

4. `04_feature_engg_and_boosting.ipynb`  
   Feature engineering and gradient boosting


## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Final logic is migrated into Python pipelines
- Notebooks are kept for transparency and reference only
