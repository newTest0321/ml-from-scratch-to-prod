**An end-to-end Machine Learning engineering project that demonstrates how an ML system evolves from experimentation into a production-ready, containerized, and deployable service.**

</div>



## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the **full lifecycle of a Machine Learning system**, from early experimentation to production-oriented deployment.

Using the **California Housing dataset**, the project focuses on **engineering practices**:

- Reproducible training pipelines
- Explicit separation between training and serving
- Model lifecycle management with MLflow
- Batch and online inference workflows
- Docker-first execution
- Kubernetes-ready architecture



## 🌿 Branch Architecture

This repository is structured as a **progressive learning path**, with each branch representing a stage in ML system maturity.

| Branch | Focus | Key Question |
|------|------|-------------|
| `ml-baseline` | ML experimentation | *How do we explore data and choose a model?* |
| `api-baseline` | Serving fundamentals | *How do we expose a trained model?* |
| `main` | Production MLOps | *How does this become reliable and deployable?* |

The `main` branch represents the **final, production-oriented design**.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Main Branch)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atkaridarshan04/ml-from-scratch-to-prod.git
cd ml-from-scratch-to-prod
git checkout main
```

The recommended way to run the system locally is **Docker**.
